<p>
Hello! Today I'm attempting my first of what will be a series of experiments in web development. 
I'm a complete beginner when it comes to web development, so this will be fun and challenging. 
My goal is to familiarize myself with a few different popular web frameworks so that I can better understand the pros and cons of each framework and grasp concepts that can only be learnt
through doing. 
</p>
Here are the web frameworks I'd like to work with: 
<ol>
<li> <h3>Python - Django</h3>
     To get started I'd like to try out the Django framework based on Python. I think Python is an easier to learn language and is something I'm already familiar with. 
     After watching a tutorial for Django, I think this would be a good place to start. 
     The first part of learning Django will be to try the getting started tutorial on the Django Website: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/
     Next, I will attempt to follow the tutorial on building a Weather App found here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-weather-app-in-django 
</li>
<li> <h3>Javascript/JSX - React</h3>
    This framework is everywhere these days. It seems like a no brainer that this must be on the list. Although there seems to be a bit of a learning curve with React, I'm willing to 
    give it a try since it's so popular. 
    With React I'll attempt to make a To-Do List App: https://www.kirupa.com/react/simple_todo_app_react.htm
</li>
<li><h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
    Ruby also appears at the top of the list in popular frameworks being used today. It follow the MVC pattern which I think will be a very important concept for me to really learn. 
    I'd like to create an app that tracks my financial portfolio and perhaps I will attempt this with Ruby on Rails!
</li>
