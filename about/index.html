<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Taarika</p> 
<p>Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at Resilience, a cyber insurance startup. I'm also a part-time graduate student at Johns Hopkins University where I'm pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science.
Prior to joining Resilience, I worked at JPMorgan Chase within the Global Technology Infrastructure organization where I was an Infrastructure Engineer on the Log Analytics team.</p>
<p>I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2016 with a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering where I took classes focused on data analytics, optimization, and operations research.</p> 
<p>Outside of work, my interests include playing tennis, investing, and travelling.</p>
